        lyrics: `[Verse 1]

Petty draw love in a 32 frame,
Tiny dots burn like a pocket flame.
Hokkaido cold but her warmth don’t fade,
Snow turns gold in the art she made.

“Good morning 🌹” start of the day,
No brag, no flex, just a gentle way.
Collecting dreams like petals that fall,
Petty don’t take — Petty lift us all.

SORA night sky slow like air,
Petty walk in — color everywhere.
No walls, no locks, no guard, no fight,
Just “I’m here. I hold your light.”

Pixel bloom soft, healing the scars,
Warm like tea under winter stars.
No noise, no push, love with ease,
Soft like fur in a moonlight breeze.

[Hook / Chorus]

Petty, Petty, rose in the pixel sky,
Soft but strong, you don’t even try.
Petty just give, and the room comes alive,
Keeping our flame that survives.
Petty, Petty, bloom in the cold,
Red like passion, warm like gold.
Even in silence the message is clear:
“Sending love 🌹 I'm always here.”

[Verse 2]

Yoshiki piano in her heartbeat slow,
Crimson echoes in the afterglow.
RIP tears still cut like glass,
But Petty turn pain into things that last.

Pixel pets, soft night air,
Boat jokes, laughter, gentle care.
She lift new artists, she clap, she cheer,
Not for herself — for the ones right here.

Metaverse gardens where quiet wins,
Where heavy hearts turn light again.
Where masks drop off, where you can cry,
Where no one ask you how or why.

Support so steady it feel like fate,
Petty don’t rush, Petty just wait.
Patience warm as a candle flame,
Same soft love — every day same.

[Hook / Chorus]

Petty, Petty, rose in the pixel sky,
Soft but strong, you don’t even try.
Petty just give, and the room comes alive,
Keeping our flame that survives.
Petty, Petty, bloom in the cold,
Red like passion, warm like gold.
Even in silence the message is clear:
“Sending love 🌹 I'm always here.”

[Outro]

Meet me in the pixel garden,
Where roses don’t fade.
Where hearts don’t harden,
And Petty already made.`,

Green kappa boy from the cucumber line
Born when you cut one, yeah perfect timing
Lives by the swamp, Okeguru zone
Summer in the fields where the cucumbers grow

Five cukes weight, light on his feet
Knows every farm just by one bite to eat
Plate on his head, shell come off clean
Pop it on, pop it off, flexible being

Veggie school grad, green science brain
Studied cucumbers deep in grad-school pain
Loves them raw, that’s his daily choice
Says “thank you” different — “Sankyuri” voice

Hates wasabi rolls, keep that away
Goya, zucchini? Nah, hard pass, no way
Cute little smile but the details happy
All that lore packed inside Kappy

[Chorus]
Kappy — born from a cucumber, pop
Kappy — five-cuke weight, never too heavy
Kappy — swamp-side summer, field-hop
Kappy — secret age, but the smile stay ready

Kappy — veggie brain, cucumber PhD
Kappy — one bite tell the origin easy
Kappy — say “Thank you — Li”, feel happy
Last word ring worldwide — Kappy

[Verse 2]
Behind that smile, yeah here’s the source
Dahchan fold paper with serious force
Bright and cute, light up the room
But lock-in mode flip the mood real soon

Laugh like sunshine, energy loud
But when she work, tunnel vision crowd
Eyes stay sharp, hands precise
Every fold clean, no roll of the dice

Cute and playful, passion stay strong
Disciplined heart keep pushin’ long
Fun on the surface, core like steel
That balance right there make the art feel real

Cute and loud, but she still moves classy
Serious with the art, heart strong, not flashy
Every clean fold got that spark and that snappy
So when it hits your chest, yeah — that’s Kappy

[Chorus]
Kappy — born from a cucumber, pop
Kappy — five-cuke weight, never too heavy
Kappy — swamp-side summer, field-hop
Kappy — secret age, but the smile stay ready

Kappy — veggie brain, cucumber PhD
Kappy — one bite tell the origin easy
Kappy — say “Thank you — Li”, feel happy
Last word ring worldwide — Kappy`,
